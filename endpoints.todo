QUESTIONS
No UI for timer
How do they select if cash or card
should customers have faceId
we need a stage to pick if otp is phone or email
when is a pro busy
no ui for setting active timer
the faceid is only for pro?
right now the face id and profile picture are literally the same
for now, the device change is otp not faceId and for pro and user?

what is the distance pricing per mile?
