  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "dev" ]
  pull_request:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: echo
        run: echo Deployment started!
