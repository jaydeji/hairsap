RICHARD
theres a new returned property for missed bookings
There is a new property called pinnedBookings in /admin/pros/:userId
There is a new cancelled pinStatus
PATCH /bookings/:id/pin/cancel to cancel pinned booking
PATCH /bookings/service to add or remove bookings. Just send all the subservices for the booking
{subServiceIds:number[],bookingId:number} 
for auto and manual bookings, you have to change subServiceId to subServiceIds
you can now book multiple services at a time

I've fixed the notifications after cancelling
